       " \"Finally a MacBook possession. Got it in 50k in Diwali sale. Technically good laptop.Good News.luxury product, niche technology, good battery life, reliable machine (other laptops crash and become defunct in 6-10 years), no anti-virus required, security of data and transactions much better. Terrific sense of possession & pride.Bad News. Problems will be there if you are switching from windows based system - very less space in hard disk, no CD drive, inability to transfer data from Mac to your existing external hard disc unless you format it, apps are mostly paid and re unreasonably expensive (no free apps which are available otherwise on google play store, even the angry bird costs Rs 400 !!), all printers are not compatible (e.g. the most economical MFD laser printer RICOH SP 111 can't be used), huge compatibility issues with Pages (MS Word) and Keynote (powerpoint) unless you master it by working on these (still mostly the document and slides either do not open in windows environment or have distortion issues). you need to spend extra for an external CD writer and tp buy a carry bag. Mac con not be connected to most of the projectors unless you buy some connectors, which are expensive and theres no clarity which one to buy and from where. you can't connect it to your TV, the ports are different and again theres no clarity - customer support, manuals or help section are silent ! Marketing strategy for Indian market, if at all has been planned, has been very bad. If these critical issues (and a few more not mentioned here) are handled properly, the Mac can sweep away other laptops in India. Presently, it doesn't seem to be happening.Overall Verdict.If compatibility issues mentioned above do not bother you, go for it. Else, think hard.  If its an emotional issue to own a long cherished Mac, then its a different thing. Go ahead and gradually you would figure out most (but not all) of the above problems, like I did.\",\n",

Apple,apple,apple, thats the first thing that must have flashed in you mind when you saw this product, so here i have a total breif review on the laptop...***Pros***4k Video Editing with Final Cut Pro X on this thing works like butter, there is heating issue that i am going to go to apple service center to get it checkedEveryday works like checking mail and is just gr8The Battery is just OVERPOWERED, works for around 11-12 hours on continuous work and 8-9 hours when editingThe graphics card scores 30 fps in cinebench which is not that badThe performance is also fine, 280 cb processor score on cinebenchSpeakers are really good with perfect bassDisplay brightness is 300 nits, which is fineThe Wi-Fi is extremely good, can get a network even from the living room while the router is in the bedroomVery thin and lightweightMacOS is good for School work if you know all the office applications for mac, for eg.Pages is WordMagSafe 2 is the best partGood Trackpad and Keyboard with backlightThe Storage is fast!, thanks to the M.2 based SSD!\n",
      "***Cons***Display, though the resolution is fairly good for a 13.3 inch display, the viewing angle is not appropriate for a 84k laptopGets heated up (Going to get it checked by apple support).\n",
      "Cooling not appropriate for this cpu, need a better thermal paste and fanRam management on MacOS Mojave is not good, 8 GBs of memory is not well distributed among all tasks running in backgroundMacOS is not made for gaming, you need to boot camp on this mac with Windows if you are really a hard-core gamerIntel HD integrated graphics at the price??\n",
      "?, god damn it apple (Though its not bad, have seen GeForce 940MX at the same price)No Force trackpadBezels are way too thick in today's standardsNo thunderbolt 3 or Usb CCan't detect Android Devices until Android Device Explorer is installedThe Storage is less!\n",
      "(128 GB, will upgrade to 256 GB in a few years)***My Verdict***This devices is for them who want Battery and Power, and people who want to do Video Editing on Final Cut Pro X, if anyone has a heat up issue than you should Call apple Support and visit one service center immediately to get your laptop checked!\n",
      "Though the graphics is OK from my view, apple could have given better graphics like the radeon vega 8 graphics or Intel Iris Plus or Pro for a laptop that is so expensive!\n",
      "Everything else is Great!\n",
      "And MacOS is not that hard, i easily use both my Lenovo Gaming PC and my apple macbook air easily!\n",
      "Go for it if you are in the criteria I explained above!\n",
      "For hard-core video editing I would recommend atleast an iMac 4k or MacBook Pro Base Model because of its cooling Fan structure, Better Graphics and CPU!\n",
      "This Air is enough to edit 4k60fps videos but will slow down a bit in 5k60fps!\n",
      "While exporting the 4k60fps video the CPU and GPU went up to 104 degrees, this is the reason i am going to apple support!\n",
      "Thank You if you read the whole review because I spent a lot of time writing this!\n",
      "*Update on 8 Oct, 2019*Apple service did nothing, so I thought of doing my own service!\n",
      "Yes, I changed the thermal paste and dusted the fan, now, everything is running even better than ever, even the heating issua is solved!\n",
      "Now while exporting a 4k 60 fps video, it's just around 80 degrees, hence no thermal throttling, Yay!\n",
      "After using Windows Operating system for the past 10+ years, I switched to Mac.\n",
      "The switch was inspired by the awesome reviews I got from my friends.\n",
      "I must say that they were all real and that the device and the tech is so very impressive.\n",

      "I am satisfied to get the marvel of a tech in my hands.\n",

      "MacBook Air is excellent.\n",
      "The build is super strong, the operating systems runs smooth.\n",

      "The only thing that can be improved is its screen (the visuals).\n",
      "Not as good as expected.\n",

      "Got it at the price of a Dell Windows laptop during Amazon sale.\n",
      "A great deal.\n",
      "Very handy laptop, light weight and portable.\n",

      "Laptop still at service center.\n",
      "Earlier i was using toshiba laptop, satellite 340,lasted 8 yrs without any problem.\n",
      "Paid a premium for macbook air very dissapointed with apple quality of products.\n",
      "And to repair it outside warranty, parts cost as much as the laptop itself🙄 I was apprehensive of buying Apple product from Amazon as some reviews suggested that imported items are being sold.\n",
      "However what I got was fresh and genuine product, I checked warranty on Apple site with serial no.\n",
      "All serial no - on bill, box, inner box and in macOS itself were consistent.\n",
      "Display is too good and it feels like butter operating the device.\n",
      "Only thing is that price difference between this and 256GB version is too much.\n",
      "I brought this mac air on sep 2017.\n",
      "From past 1 week I am not able to turn on my mac, went to apple store and after troubleshooting they said it is having motherboard problem and need to replace which cost 50k, I was shocked and said how come in less than 2 year mac will have this issue.\n",
      "So kindly please beawre on this big bug mac air.\n",
      "Don't want to mention anything for apple MAC book :)Super product I have my worst nightmare with the macbook air I bought.\n",
      "I bought it on theOctober 2018, it got into teouble in the month april 2019.\n",

      "I dont know what to do with this.\n",
      "Everything about this product seems to be fine as of now.\n",
      "Got an option to upgrade to higher OS and install tools required for my work.\n",
      "Except for not so good sound quality while watching movies through itunes stores, other aspect seems to be fine.\n",
      "Higher storage options (256 GB) may be required for power users who may want to app development on this system.\n",
      "Current configuration suits light - medium heavy user(I belong to this category)- (need xcode debugging feature for my projects ).\n",
      "I was looking for an affordable long lasting light laptop and my search led me to this.\n",
      "I know Apple has launch a new Air but this is still a good performer and with the recent price cut this laptop makes so much sense.\n",
      "I was using MacBook Pro for last 8 years, and after it retired this replaced the Pro and is not doing a bad job at it at all.\n",
      "This is the worst  apple product I have ever seen ...6 month After purchase of this fake book ...some of its keys of keyboard  stopped working ...So the service center  replace my keyboard with the new one ...But after some months with  the new replaced  keyboard some of its key again stopped working .All these things happen in one year and 3 month timeline which is roughly 1.5 years of original purchase date ...\n",
      "...When I spoke to the service center they told me that the warranty is over you need to pay 12000 rs ...So I don't have any option.\n",
      "The cost is too high.\n",
      "..So now I m working with the external keyboard which cost me merely 200 rs ... My friend bought the same macbook from the showroom and i must say its really working good and it doesnt show any fault at all .Till now .i wish i also bought this macbook from the showroom .... Amazing product..it has quality written all over it..great battery, easy to adapt if you are moving from windows..the trackpad, gestures, everything is so damm goodHad read many reviews about the display being bad...it is..if you are trying to look at atomic level details..its a fantastic screen with great audio output..Everything g screams quality and premium about the macbook..love it.\n",
      "From the very beginning the battery life was horrible .\n",
      "hardly 2 hours.\n",
      "And after using it for just a year it just stopped working .\n",
      "and i cannot even charge it.\n",
      "Terrible product sold by Amazon The rating isn't for Apple's performance.\n",
      "I exchanged my old MacBook Air 11' (2013) for MacBook Air 13.3' (2017): and I haven't been disappointed.\n",
      "They both are fantastic machines, there isn't a bit of change except the screen - it is slightly bigger and better...The rating for the seller - I would give 5 star for delivery and 4 star for packaging.\n",
      "However, the product came with multiple scratches.\n",
      "I am unable to conclude whose fault it is- Apple or the reseller (in this case - Cloudtail India Pvt Ltd).I have restored my previous backup and will observe the performance over the week.\n",
      "If it under performs- I will report it to the authorities.\n",
